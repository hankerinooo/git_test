        I'm <strong>really</strong> enjoying web development! 
        I just started yesterday, but its really starting to click for me. 
        I really enjoy using the CLI. Its so <em>satisfying</em> to feel like I'm actually 
        using my computer in a more personal and specific way. These are some of my favorite things I've learned how to do:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating new documents with the touch command</li>
        <li>Navigate file systems with CD</li>
        <li>Easily save whole databases and files with Git</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If I were to rank my top 3 favorite commands they would be:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>cd</li>
        <li>touch</li>
        <li>mkdir</li>
    </ol>
